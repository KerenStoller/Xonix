# The Revenge Of The Chick - Setup Guide

Welcome! 
This Unity project includes **three scenes** that work together to run the game:

- **`WelcomeScene`** — the main menu  
- **`GameScene`** — where gameplay happens  
- **`WonOrLostScene`** — shows whether you win or lose  

Before pressing **Play**, make sure the scenes are set up correctly so everything works as expected.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open the Project
Open the project in **Unity**.

### 2. Add Scenes to Build Settings
Go to **File → Build Settings**, and ensure these three scenes are added:

### 3. Open Scenes Additively
You’ll need all three scenes visible in the **Hierarchy** for setup:
1. In the menu bar, go to **Scene → Open Scene Additive** and select **GameScene**.  
2. Repeat the same for **WonOrLostScene**.

### 4. Unload Extra Scenes
Once they’re open, **unload** the last two scenes (**GameScene** and **WonOrLostScene**):

- In the **Hierarchy**, right-click each → **Unload Scene**

Leave **only** `WelcomeScene` loaded.

## You’re Ready!
Your scene setup should look like this:

Scenes In Hierarchy
├── WelcomeScene (Loaded)
├── GameScene (Unloaded)
└── WonOrLostScene (Unloaded)

Now you’re ready to **press Play** and enjoy the game!
